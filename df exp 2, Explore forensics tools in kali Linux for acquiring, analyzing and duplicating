Explore forensics tools in kali Linux for acquiring, analyzing and duplicating

   The dd tool is used to copy bits from one file to another. Copying bits in this manner is the 
basis for all forensic duplication tools
  DD in general is a data management tool and was not particularly built for forensics 
purposes. Therefore it has its shortcomings.
